##IMDb Clone App
---
üïπ Live Demo: https://cbd23.github.io/watchlist-app/

### Introduction
---
This IMDb Clone App is my final project for graduating from the **Web Development with JavaScript** course at the [Informal School of IT](https://scoalainformala.ro/).
I created it using the API provided by The Movie Database (TMDB). I chose to build this project because I wanted to challenge myself like never before and also apply as many newly learned concepts as I could, from writing semantic HTML to promises and asynchronous code.

### Usage
---
üì° Explore the most popular movies right now or scroll through sections like **In theaters**, **Upcoming**, **Top picks** and **Trending people**.
üîç Perform a search using one of the four available filters: **All** / **Movies** / **Celebs** / **Keywords**.
üçø Watch the trailer of your fav movie.
üíæ Add movies to your **Watchlist**, mark them as 'watched' and remove them whenever you want.

### Technologies
---
I created this project using:
***HTML**
***CSS** - using both Flexbox and Grid
***JavaScript** - 'standard' code style
***npm** for dependency management 
***Webpack** for bundling & optimizing assets for deployment

### Future updates
---
***mobile responsive design** - users will be able to access & enjoy the app on mobile devices
***add movies found using Search** to your watchlist - you'll also be able to see more details about a movie by opening a 'movie card' when you click on its title/poster
***local storage** for the **Watchlist** - movies added to your watchlist and/or marked as 'viewed' won't be lost on page reload/close
